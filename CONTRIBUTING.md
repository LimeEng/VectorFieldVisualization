## Work flow

All code changes happens through *pull requests*. A great summary to what this file will contain can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), describing Github Flow

To create a pull request, follow these steps:

- Create a new branch with a descriptive name from master
- If necessary, add tests to the code. (And make sure they pass!)
- Update documentation, if necessary. 
- Try to follow the coding standard already present
- Open a new pull request! The pull request should have a commit message explaining what changes were done.
